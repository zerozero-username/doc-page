                While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language,
                this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also
                describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the
                long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide
                access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python
                programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems
                that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and
                enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral
                APIs.

                Built-in Functions
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available. They
                are listed here in alphabetical order.
            </p>
            <h4>
                abs
            </h4>
            <p>
                Return the absolute value of a number. The argument may be an integer or a floating point number. If the
                argument is a complex number, its magnitude is returned.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                all
            </h4>
            <p>
                Return <b>True</b> if all elements of the <i>iterable</i> are true (or if the iterable is empty).
                Equivalent to:

                <table>
                    <code>
                        def all(iterable):
                            for element in iterable:
                                if not element:
                                    return False
                            return True
                    </code>
                </table>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                any
            </h4>
            <p>
                Return <b>True</b> if any element of the <i>iterable</i> is true. If the iterable is empty, return
                <b>False</b>. Equivalent to:

                <table>
                    <code>
                        def any(iterable):
                            for element in iterable:
                                if element:
                                    return True
                            return False
                    </code>
                </table>
            </p>
            <h4>bin</h4>
            <p>Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed with <i>“0b”</i>. The result is a valid Python
                expression.
                If x is not a Python <i>int</i> object, it has to define an <b>__index__()</b> method that returns an
                integer. Some
                examples:

                <table>
                    <code>
                        >>> bin(3)
                        '0b11'
                        >>> bin(-10)
                        '-0b1010'
                    </code>
                </table>
            </p>
            <p>
                If prefix “0b” is desired or not, you can use either of the following ways:
                
                <table>
                    <code>
                        >>> format(14, '#b'), format(14, 'b')
                        ('0b1110', '1110')
                        >>> f'{14:#b}', f'{14:b}'
                        ('0b1110', '1110') 
                    </code>
                </table>
            </p>
